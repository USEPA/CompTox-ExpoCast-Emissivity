## Abstract

The characterization of chemicals in household products is important for understanding this potential source of chemical exposure. Increasingly, suspect screening and untargeted analysis techniques are used to characterize as many chemical signatures as possible. Solids such as household products are most conveniently prepared using solvent extraction, revealing what chemicals are contained within the product matrix but providing no information about the potential of those chemicals to leave the matrix and cause an actual exposure. In this work, the profile and relative abundances of “extractable” chemical signatures found after solvent extraction with dichloromethane are compared to those “emittable” to the headspace at two different temperatures. A total of 81 household products were analyzed by two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. This study retrospectively fuses data collected in separate efforts over approximately 4 years and 13 analytical batches. Management of the data is made possible by recent developments in two-dimensional gas chromatography data processing systems such as Highlight™, allowing large amounts of complex spectral data to be efficiently aligned and co-processed. Initial feature finding and integration was performed using commercial software, followed by machine learning processing using the custom-developed Highlight software. Compounds were generically classified as aromatic heteroatom, aromatic hydrocarbon, glycol, hydrocarbon, long chain heteroatom, non-aromatic heteroatom, and unknown/unclassified. Class-based retention time and abundance trends were observed. Liquid extraction resulted in the greatest number of features and the highest relative abundances, while low temperature emission conditions produced the smallest number of features and lowest relative abundances. This work provides valuable insight into the plausibility and level at which chemicals detected from a GC-based liquid extraction workflow will emit from a household product. This may assist exposomic and chemical biomonitoring efforts by identifying those chemicals for which human exposure is more probable.
